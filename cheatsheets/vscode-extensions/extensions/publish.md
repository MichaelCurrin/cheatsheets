description: How to publish your extension to the VS Code extension marketplace

I haven't gone through that flow yet but the VS Code docs will help you out. See the [Publishing extensions](https://code.visualstudio.com/api/working-with-extensions/publishing-extension) help guide if you want more info.

Some other steps are needed first like `login` and `create-publisher`.

When you are ready, run this this command:

```sh
$ vsce publish
# <publisherID>.myExtension published to VS Code MarketPlace
```
