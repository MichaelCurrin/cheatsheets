## Install

See this [gist](https://gist.github.com/MichaelCurrin/bdc34c554fa3023ee81449eb77375fcb).


## Upgrade

This command was suggested by NPM upgrade Yarn. This looks the same as the install command.

```sh
$ curl --compressed -o- -L https://yarnpkg.com/install.sh | bash
```

Alternatively, use NPM as install steps:

```sh
$ npm upgrade -g yarn
```
