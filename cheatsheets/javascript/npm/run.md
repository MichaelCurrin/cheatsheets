See [npm run-script](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/run-script) in the docs.


## Flags

> You can use the --if-present flag to avoid exiting with a non-zero exit code when the script is undefined. This lets you run potentially undefined scripts without breaking the execution chain.

e.g.

```sh
$ npn run build --if-present
```
