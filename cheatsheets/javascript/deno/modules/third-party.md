# Third-party module

> Deno can import modules from any location on the web, like GitHub, a personal webserver, or a CDN like pika.dev or jspm.io.
> 
> To make it easier to consume third party modules Deno provides some built in tooling like `deno info` and `deno doc`. deno.land also provides a web UI for viewing module documentation. It is available at doc.deno.land.
> 
> deno.land also provides a simple public hosting service for ES modules that work with Deno. It can be found at deno.land/x. [source](https://deno.land/)


From [deno.land/x](https://deno.land/x):

> deno.land/x is a URL rewriting service for Deno scripts.
>
> The basic format of code URLs is `https://deno.land/x/MODULE_NAME@BRANCH/SCRIPT.ts`.
>
> If you leave out the branch, it will default to the moduleâ€™s default branch, usually master.
