# Deno


Deno is a JavaScript runtime which is a replacement to Node.js and with a few enhancements.

- [deno.land](https://deno.land/) - Deno homepage
    > A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.


## Why Deno?

Are you tired of choosing and managing separate dependencies which do all these tasks?

- Lint JS (ESlint)
- Format JS (Prettier)
- Bundle JS (Webpack or Bundler)
- Transpile to older JS (Babel)
- Transpile TS to JS (TypeScript)
- Run tests (Jasmine, Jest, Mocha ...)

Then consider using Deno. It is a modern alternative to NodeJS by the same author and it provides all the functionality just mentioned above - without extra dependencies.
