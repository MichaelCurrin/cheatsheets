Deno is a JavaScript runtime which is a replacement to Node.js and with a few enhancements.

- [deno.land](https://deno.land/) - Deno homepage
    > A secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript.


## Why Deno?

Are you tired of choosing and managing separate dependencies which do all these tasks?

- lint JS (eslint)
- format JS (prettier)
- bundle JS (Webpack or Bundler)
- transpile to older JS (Babel)
- transpile TS to JS (TypeScript)
- run tests (Jasmine or Jest)

Then consider using Deno. It is a modern alternative to NodeJS by the same author and it provides all the functionality just mentioned above - without extra depenedencies.
