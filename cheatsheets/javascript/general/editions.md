# JavaScript Editions
> Description of the JavaScript releases over the years

ECMAScript (or JavaScript) is just a specification. One gets published every year it seems and it becomes the standard. Browsers work to support the syntax. Server-side environments like Node and Deno add support to.


## Compare releases

See [ESNext](https://www.javascripttutorial.net/es-next/) on the JavaScript Tutorial website.

It compares releases in order, with a short write-up for each. Further down, there is a table of ES1 to the latest version.

Here are the most recent rows. I left off the release date, as the official name also tells you the year at least (since ES5.1 that is).


Edition	| Official name	
---     | ---           
ES11    | ES2020
ES10    | ES2019 
ES9     | ES2018
ES8     | ES2017
ES7     | ES2016
ES6     | ES2015
