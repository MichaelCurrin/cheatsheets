# Python


Some useful commands, boilerplate code from my existing projects or things to use in new development.

See [pythoncheatsheet.org/](https://www.pythoncheatsheet.org/)

Find example usage - see [programcreek.com/python/index/module/list](https://www.programcreek.com/python/index/module/list). When you go into functions of a module, you can see where other code uses that.
