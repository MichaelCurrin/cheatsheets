# Clean code

On how to write clean code, according to Uncle Bob. He has a blog, gives talks at conferences and he has an online course which he has released on video. There is some duplication across the videos.

Quotes by Uncle Bob and others he references in the video. My comments are in brackets.

- The only way to go fast is to go well. (And in coding that means to stay clean.)
- If we all checkin a module (into version control) so it is better than when we checked it out, then all our code would get better with time.

What is clean code?

- Clean code is elegant (it does a lot with a simple command), efficient (saves processing resources) and does one thing well.
- Clean code is simple, direct and reads like well written prose. There are no surprises. It is what you expect.
