# Regex

{% raw %}

Don't blindly copy regular expressions from online libraries or discussion forums. Always test them on your own data and with your own applications.


## Resources

- [regex101.com](https://regex101.com/)
- [regexr.com](https://regexr.com/)


## Character types

```re
\d
\D

\w
\W

[a-z]
[a-zA-Z]
[a-zA-Z0-9]

\s
\S

.
\.

:alpha:
:digit:
:space:

```


## Repeat

```re
\w+
\w*
\w?

\w{2}
\w{4}
\w{2,4}
```


## Insert

Note use of `$1` to keep the original text. Brackets seem to be needed for this to work.

Applied VS Code regex replace.

### Add character

Add header symbol before a number.

- Find: `\d`
- Replace with: `# $1`

### Add break tag

Insert `br` tag at the end of lines which are not headings or empty lines.

- Find: `(^[^#].+)`
- Replace with: `$1<br>`


## Modifiers

The notes here are for JavaScript but there will be equivalents in other languages.

### Multiline

[m modifier](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_m.asp) for multiline searches.

> Do a multiline search for "is" at the beginning of each line in a string:

```javascript
var str = "\nIs th\nis it?";
var patt1 = /^is/m;
```

> The m modifier treat beginning (`^`) and end (`$`) characters to match the beginning or end of each line of a string (delimited by `\n` or `\r`), rather than just the beginning or end of the string.


### Global

[g modified](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_g.asp)

```javascript
var str = "Is this all there is?";
var patt1 = /is/g;
```

> The `g` modifier is used to perform a global match (find all matches rather than stopping after the first match).

### Insensitive

[i modifier](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_regexp_i.asp)

> Do a case-insensitive search for "w3schools" in a string:

```javascript
var str = "Visit W3Schools";
var patt1 = /w3schools/i;
```


## Exclude

### Exclude characters

Use `^` inside `[]` to exclude. Note `a-z` will work and a `-` must be at the start of the end to match a literal `-`.

```re
[^\w-]
```

### Exclude words

Source: [regextester](https://www.regextester.com/15)

```re
^((?!badword).)*$
```

```
badword
test      # match
one two   # match
abadwords
three     # match
```

Multiple exclusions:

```re
?!(foo|bar)

?!(http|[{#])
```


## URLs

### URL validation

#### Detailed

Source: [regexr.com/39nr7](https://regexr.com/39nr7)

This will match multiple URLs on a line.

```re
[(http(s)?):\/\/(www\.)?a-zA-Z0-9@:%._\+~#=]{2,256}\.[a-z]{2,6}\b([-a-zA-Z0-9@:%_\+.~#?&//=]*)
```

#### Simplified

I made this and tested in VS Code.

```re
https:\/\/[\w./#-]*
```

It does not match `?=` or trailing `/` or Jekyll `{{` URLs.

Add a space or `\s` or `\(` at the start to find URL in a certain context.


#### Security

Insecure URLs excluding localhost. Make secure. Using VS Code find and replace.

- Find:
    ```re
    http:\/\/(?!localhost)[\w./#-]*
    ```
- Replace:
    ```re
    $1s$2
    ```

### Markdown URLs

- Internal and external paths. Allows for empty target too - `()`.
    ```re
    \[.+\]\(.*\)
    ```
- Internal path
    ```re
    \[.+\]\((?!http).+\)
    ```
- Internal absolute path
    ```re
    \[.+\]\(/.+\)
    ```
- External URLs
    ```re
    \[.+\]\(http.+\)
    ```
- HTTP URL that is not secure
    ```re
    \[.+\]\(http[^s].+\)
    ```
- Internal path which is not a `#` ID reference or Jekyll link.
    ```re
    \[.+\]\((?!(http|[{#])).+\)
    ```

Note `www` without a protocol is also external but not considered here as I don't use that style.

#### Convert to markdown URL

Find an external URL and convert to `[]()` format, remove protocol and `www` in the label - using regex find and replace in VS Code.

Includes an optional trailing slash (if not matched, this gets left outside the pattern after the `()` part).

- Find:
    ```re
     (https:\/\/)(www\.)?([\w./-]+[\w-]+)(/?)
    ```
- Replace:
    ```re
     [$3]($1$2$3$4)
    ```

Note leading space. This could be remove for lines starting with URL.

Sample:

- ` https://stackedit.io/` => ` [stackedit.io](https://stackedit.io/)`
- ` https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/nested-jekyll-menus` => ` [github.com/MichaelCurrin/nested-jekyll-menu](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/nested-jekyll-menus`
- ` https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/nested-jekyll-menus/` => ` [github.com/MichaelCurrin/nested-jekyll-menu](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/nested-jekyll-menus/`

This variation handles `#` ID values.

- Find:
    ```re
     (https:\/\/)(www\.)?([\w./-]+[\w-]+)(#[\w-]*)?(/?)
    ```
- Replace:
    ```re
     [$3]($1$2$3$4$5)
    ```


## Email address

### Basic

Check for one `@` and a domain with at least one dot.

```re
^[^\s@]+@[^\s@]+\.[^\s@]+$
```

### Advanced

Stricter check on first character, disallowed characters and invalid domain.

```re
^[a-zA-Z0-9.!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+@[a-zA-Z0-9-]+(?:\.[a-zA-Z0-9-]+)*$
```

### RFC

StackOverflow link: [How to validate an email in Javascript](https://stackoverflow.com/a/1373724)

The specific answer linked suggests this most complete answer but warns not to use it.

> The official standard is known as [RFC 2822][]. It describes the syntax that valid email addresses must adhere to. You can (but you shouldn't â€” [read on][]) implement it with this regular expression.

[RFVC 2822]: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc2822#section-3.4.1
[read on]: http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html

```re
(?:[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*|"(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21\x23-\x5b\x5d-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])*")@(?:(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?|\[(?:(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?)\.){3}(?:25[0-5]|2[0-4][0-9]|[01]?[0-9][0-9]?|[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9]:(?:[\x01-\x08\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x1f\x21-\x5a\x53-\x7f]|\\[\x01-\x09\x0b\x0c\x0e-\x7f])+)\])
```

We get a more practical implementation of RFC 2822 if we omit the syntax using double quotes and square brackets. It will still match 99.99% of all email addresses in actual use today.

```re
[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+(?:\.[a-z0-9!#$%&'*+/=?^_`{|}~-]+)*@(?:[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?\.)+[a-z0-9](?:[a-z0-9-]*[a-z0-9])?
```

You'd be far better off not validating an email with JS at all and instead using

```html
<input type="email" />
```

to provide immediate user feedback and, of course, strong validation on the server receiving the input. 

You can still style your inputs based on valid and invalid input and the validation is done for you.

### Between breaks

[How to Find or Validate an Email Address](http://www.regular-expressions.info/email.html)

```re
\b[A-Z0-9._%+-]+@[A-Z0-9.-]+\.[A-Z]{2,}\b
```

Presumably using case-insensitive matching.
