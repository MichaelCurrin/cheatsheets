## Page-specific

Override the permalink on a page in the frontmatter.

```
---
permalink: /about/
---

```

## Global


Pages and collections (excluding posts and drafts) donâ€™t have time and categories. These aspects of the permalink style are ignored for the output.

For pages, the `:title` is equivalent to `:basename`.

**Permalink Patterns**  
Jekyll allows you to redefine the entire default pattern in the `_config.yml` This will affect both pages and posts with one important distinction: posts have access to categories and date and time elements from the Front Matter, while pages do not. Page URLs will follow the pattern, gracefully omitting any post-specific elements.


#
`permalink: /:categories/:year/:month/:day/:title/`, you can just type `permalink: pretty`.
