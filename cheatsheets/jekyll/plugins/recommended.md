## Embedding

- [jekyll-gist](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-gist)
	- See _Installation_ section of README for setup.
	- This will take a gist ID and optional filename and add the JS snippet to your page.
	- You can also just use the gist's standard embed functionality directly without this plugin, by clicking Embed on a gist or creating script tag yourself.
