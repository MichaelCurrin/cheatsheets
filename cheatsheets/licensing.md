# Licensing cheatsheet
> How to choose and apply a license for your project.

## Notes

This is based on the notice in one license and can also be included in README under LICENSE. The license doesn't need to be used unless for _substantial_ portions.

> The above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in all copies or substantial portions of the Software.

Some projects have `LICENSE-source` next to `LICENSE` - add that to doc instructions.

### GNU General Public License v3.0

Description:

- > Permissions of this strong copyleft license are conditioned on making available complete source code of licensed works and modifications, which include larger works using a licensed work, under the same license.
