# File naming

From Woorank:

> Using underscores in your URL makes it hard for search engines to determine your site's relevance to a search. Google sees hyphens as word separators while underscores are ignored. So the search engine sees https://thebuckfeverunderground.co.za/music/last_days_of_beautiful/ as all one word. Use hyphens in your URLs instead: https://thebuckfeverunderground.co.za/music/last-days-of-beautiful/.

> We've detected underscores in your URLs. Change underscores to hyphens to maximize your SEO.
