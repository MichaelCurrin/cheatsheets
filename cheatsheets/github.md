# Github cheatsheet

## Update fork

Add changes from upstream original repo into your fork.

The compare and Pull Request view in Github is not so nice for this. You can do it by URL:

e.g. Merging from repo owned by `helaili` into my own.

```
https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/jekyll-action/compare/master...helaili:master
```
