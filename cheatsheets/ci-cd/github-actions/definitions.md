## Personal access tokens

aka "PAT"

> Tokens you have generated that can be used to access the GitHub API.

> Make sure to copy your new personal access token now. You wonâ€™t be able to see it again!

If you have one token across repos, then if need to regenerate, then you'd have to go and update everywhere.

So you might want to create a PAT for each application as a one to one mapping.
