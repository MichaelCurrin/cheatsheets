# Flexbox


## Align

From [flexbox froggy](https://flexboxfroggy.com/).

`align-content` determines the spacing between lines

`align-items` determines how the items as a whole are aligned within the container.

When there is only one line, `align-content` has no effect


## Jusify content

```css
#pond {
  display: flex;
justify-content: flex-end
}
```

- `flex-start`: Items align to the left side of the container.
- `flex-end`: Items align to the right side of the container.
- `center`: Items align at the center of the container.
- `space-between: Items display with equal spacing between them.
- `space-around`: Items display with equal spacing around them.
