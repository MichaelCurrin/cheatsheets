title: Common

My commonly used commands for quick reference. Especially the command and flag combinations I **frequently** use or need to lookup or get confused with (e.g. do I use `-r` or `-v` on `git branch`, or was that `git remote` ?).

Ideally this can all fit on a page especially by leaving out explanations and output or putting them in compressed setions. There can be links to other sections for more variations, or details on that subcommand.


## Add all

```sh
$ git add . -A
```

## Remote full URLs

```sh
$ git remote -v
```

## All branches

```sh
$ git branch -a
```
