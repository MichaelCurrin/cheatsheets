NAME
       git-diff - Show changes between commits, commit and working tree, etc

SYNOPSIS
       git diff [<options>] [<commit>] [--] [<path>...]
       git diff [<options>] --cached [<commit>] [--] [<path>...]
       git diff [<options>] <commit> <commit> [--] [<path>...]
       git diff [<options>] <blob> <blob>
       git diff [<options>] --no-index [--] <path> <path>

DESCRIPTION
       Show changes between the working tree and the index or a tree, changes between the index and a tree, changes between two
       trees, changes between two blob objects, or changes between two files on disk.
       
       ...
```


## Default

```sh
git diff
```

This will include:

- staged
- unstaged

But not:

- untracked


If you want untracked files, then git status works file. The line count doesn't matter so much as the files are new and there is no lines changed.


## Staged

Show diff of stages files only. 

All the other flags below also assume all files that are tracked, unless you specifically ask for staged/cached, which can include previously untracked files.

```sh
$ git diff --cached
```

Note `--cached` and `--staged` are synonyms.


## No index

Compare when at least one of the file is out the repo, or the entire command is run outside the repo.

```sh
$ git diff [<options>] --no-index [--] <path> <path> 
```

## Ignore submodules

```
--ignore-submodules[=<when>]
```

> Ignore changes to submodules in the diff generation. <when> can be either "none", "untracked", "dirty" or "all", which is the default.


## Output modes

### Patch

This is the default.

```sh
$ git diff -p
```

This can be hidden with `s` for `--no-patch`


### Output to file

> Output to a specific file instead of stdout.

```
--output=<file>
```


### Raw

> Generate the diff in raw format.

e.g.

```sh
$ git diff --raw
:100755 100755 0f5324b 0000000 M        genesis/install.sh
:100755 100755 b3858ab 0000000 M        genesis/upgrade.sh
```

### Stat

`--stat` - see [docs](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-diff#Documentation/git-diff.txt---statltwidthgtltname-widthgtltcountgt)

```sh
$ git diff --stat
 genesis/install.sh |  5 ++---
 genesis/upgrade.sh | 14 ++++++++++++++
 2 files changed, 16 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
```

### Short stat

> Output only the last line of the --stat format containing total number of modified files, as well as number of added and deleted lines.

```sh
$ git diff --shortstat
 2 files changed, 16 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
```

### Summary

`--summary` 

> Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as creations, renames and mode changes.

```sh
$ git diff --summary --staged
```
```
 create mode 100644 src/my-git.ts
```

### Compact summary

`--compact-summary`

> Output a condensed summary of extended header information such as file creations or deletions ("new" or "gone", optionally "+l" if itâ€™s a symlink) and mode changes ("+x" or "-x" for adding or removing executable bit respectively) in diffstat. The information is put between the filename part and the graph part. Implies --stat.

e.g. 

```sh
$ git diff --compact-summary
```
```
 genesis/install.sh |  5 ++---
 genesis/upgrade.sh | 14 ++++++++++++++
 2 files changed, 16 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
```
```
 src/my-git.ts (new) | 39 +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
 1 file changed, 39 insertions(+)
```

### Name only

```sh
$ git diff --name-only
genesis/install.sh
genesis/upgrade.sh
```
