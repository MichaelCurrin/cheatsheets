# mod


```sh
$ go help mode
```

```
usage: go mod init [module]

Init initializes and writes a new go.mod to the current directory,
in effect creating a new module rooted at the current directory.
The file go.mod must not already exist.
If possible, init will guess the module path from import comments
(see 'go help importpath') or from version control configuration.
To override this guess, supply the module path as an argument.
