## Resources

- Homepage: [yaml.org](https://yaml.org/)
- [YAML validator](https://codebeautify.org/yaml-validator)
- [JSON to YAML](https://onlineyamltools.com/convert-yaml-to-json) - useful to check your YAML data got interpreted as expected. The JSON will be verbose but precise/explicit.


## YAML type formatting

Use `.yml` or `.yaml` extension.

YAML files strictly should start with triple dash, but in practice this is only used sometimes.

e.g.

```yaml
my_string: Hello
```

```yaml
---
my_string: Hello
```

For a Jekyll site:

```yaml
---
my_string: Hello
---
```
