# Cheatsheets
> Collection of minimal code snippets across languages for easy reference

I add code here if I find I use it more than once, from other cheatsheets, StackOverflow or my own creation. There may be links, but the idea is to be explicit here to avoid clicking through and also the risk of external content moving/disappearing.

The idea is to have boilerplate and templates which I already I understand and can use as a reference. This is not aimed at learning the language or concept for the first time.

The code here might not actually run, especially templates.

I am likely going to copy-paste the things in here often. Just to make typing it that much easier and to save a Stack Overflow search for an item I found before.

I might memorize the items, or just type them out enough times that I know them, but I keep as a cheatsheet for long term use.

There are also hacks which are not necessarily useful to someone learning the language but something I use.

There might also be links to cheatsheets I've found. I might take an existing cheatsheet and cut it down to the stuff I don't know so well yet but am likely to need.

The idea is to keep this project as a lean as possible. Wider details on learning or using a language are covered in my other projects.

There may be missing context or explanations and obvious things are excluded. As the cheatsheet is intended for myself mainly.

## Resources

Any links to tutorials and more detail will probably be added to my [Learn to Code](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/learn-to-code) project instead.

Any pieces for creating the doc and chore files of new projects will be added to [Repo Boiler Plates](https://github.com/MichaelCurrin/repo-boilerplates) project.
