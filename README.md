# Cheatsheets
> Snippets across languages as an easy reference

I add code here if I find I use it more than once, from other cheatsheets, StackOverflow or my own creation. There may be links, but the idea is to be explict here to avoid clicking through and also the risk of external content moving/disappearing.

The code here might not actually run and just be a template.

There might also be links to cheat sheets I've found.

The idea is to keep this project as a lean as possible. Wider details on learning or using a language are covered in my other projects. 

There may be missing context or explanations and obvious things are excluded. As the cheatsheet is intended for myself mainly.
